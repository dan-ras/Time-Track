# Time-Track
Senior Project, 2022

## Description of project: 
The project is an iOS application that allows a user to track time clocked in. Most employers have 
methods for this, however, some do not and request that the employee tracks their own hours at work. 
This project will provide an elegant way for an individual to keep track of time worked and submit 
their time to an employer.
